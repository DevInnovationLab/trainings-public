            ## Motivation

            This session will discuss practices that will help you put the following 
            [principles for working with data](https://devinnovationlab.github.io/guides/principles/working-with-data.html) into practice:

            - Touch whatever you want...
            - ... and please don't move anything
            - Be mindful of senstitive data
            - Create good data sets

            Note:
            - We will use an example from a project that Rathan has been working on
            - That's the data that you see on the projector
            - Rathan can give some context on the project

            ## What is the first thing you notice when you receive new data?

            <div class="fragment fade-in">
              <ul>
                <li>File format</li>
                <li>Size</li>
                <li>Sensitivity</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            Note:
            Look at the example data and see what we find
            - Excel File
            - One data set per month
            - Around 40k obs per file
            - 1-3 MB per file

            ---
            
            ## What is the first thing you do when you receive new data?

            <div class="fragment fade-in">
              <ul>
                <li>Decide where to store it</li>
                <li>Save a protected copy</li>
                <li>Open the data</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            
            ---
            
            ## Where to store data

            - According to UChicago guidelines, data should be stored in Box
            - Box has a *lock* feature, that prevents files from being modified or deleted
            - This feature should be used for any data that you cannot recreate
            - Keep this original data in locked storage in the same file format and with the same content as you received
            - You can save any necessary changes as new files

            <p class="highlight fragment fade-in">
              Ideally, decisions on folder structure and data storage plaftorms have already been made and documented ahead of time.
              <div class="highlight fragment fade-in">
                If that was not the case, take a moment to really think about it before you place data data somewhere you'll never find it again.
              </div>
            </p>
           
            Note: 
            - Large data sets may need special storage
            - UChicago has a computing cluster that we can access for this
            - Let Luiza know if you need it

            ---

            ## Importing data

            - We often receive data in formats that are not easy to open in statistical software
            - The **second** thing you should to do if that applies to your data is to save it in a format that is appropriate for your software
              - `.rds` for R
              - `.dta` for Stata
            - This will allow you to open the data faster and to preserve variable formats such as dates, factors and labels
            - If your data contains dates or text, be mindful of how this information is encoded

            ---

            ## Useful tools to save data

            - In R: 
              - `write_rds` + `read_rds` (from `readr`, for `.rds` files)
              - `save` + `load` (for `.Rda` files)
            - In Stata:
              - `save` + `use`
              - `compress`
              - `saveold`
              - `iesave` (from `ietoolkit`)

            Note:
            - Show data in R now
            - The month name is only available in the file name, and sometimes it is abbreviated

            ---

            ## Working with sensitive data

            - If you received sensitive data, but it is not strictly necessary for analysis, save sensitive data fields separately from non-sensitive ones after importing it into R or Stata
            - Sensitive data requires specific workflows that may take more time to implement
            - Make sure you have a way to reconnect sensitive and non-sensistive fields if needed

            Note:
            show data in R:
            - main data without names
            - other data table with only names and IDs

            ## Data cleaning

            Note:

            - Cleaning data is a key step in creating a good data set
            - The purpose of data cleaning is to preserve the information contained in a data set, while making it easier to handle in statistical software

        </section>
        
        <section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
          <textarea data-template>

            ## What is the first thing you look for when you start cleaning a data set?

              <ul>
                <li>Unit(s) of observation<span class="fragment fade-in">: does this data set have a <em>key</em>?</span></li>
                <li>Variables included<span class="fragment fade-in">: do you understand what they mean?</span></li>
                <li>Type of data contained in each variable (continuous, categorical, binary, date)
                  <span class="fragment fade-in">: in what <em>format</em> is the data stored (string, numeric, date, factor, logical)? 
                    Is this the most efficient way to to store this type of variable?</li>
              </ul>

            Note: 
            - What is the unit of observation? 
            - (it's a trick question, we will learn more about this in the tidy data session)
            - Numeric data stored in text format  

            ---

            ## Data format

            Statistical software usually have a preferred way of handling different types of data

            ---

            ## Data format

            - In R:
              - Categorical variables are stored as factors
              - Binary variables are stored as booleans
              - Text variables are stored as characters
              - Numeric variables as stored as integers or numerics

            ---

            ## Data format

            - In Stata:
              - Categorical variables are stored as labeled integers
              - Binary variables are stored as 0/1 integers
              - Text variables are stored as strings
              - Numeric variables are stored as bytes, ints, longs, floats, or doubles

            <ul>
              There are many advantages to using data in the software-specific format for each data type:
              <ul>
                <li>Using type-specific functions (for example for dates, text, and factors)</li>

            ## Data validation

            - Once we have a data set that can be easily handled in statistical software, it's time to start touching it
            - The objective of data validation is to ensure the quality of the data and to document patterns that may bias our analysis
            - At the end of this process, we should have a data set that is very similar to the clean data set, but that may contain some corrections
            - Data validation should also be documented by recording any issues found in the data -- this will be discussed in more detail during the data documentation session
          </textarea>          
        </section>

        <section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
          <textarea data-template>
            ## No data is safe from quality issues

            Note: 
            - raise your hand if you ever found something in your data that simply did not make sense
            - raise your hand if you are in the habit of testing the quality of the data before analyzing it
            - raise your hand if your data processing code automatically flags issues in the data

            ---

            ## Common issues to look for

            - Data set keys
            - Completeness
            - Consistency
            - Extreme values

            ---

            ## Exploring new data

            - What is the **unit of observation** in this data table?
            - What column in the data **identifies** a unit in this data table?

            ---

            ## Data set key (ID variable)

            <ol>
                <li>Uniquely identifies observations</li>
                <li>Fully identifies observations</li>
                <div class="fragment fade-in">
                    <li>Anonymous</li>
                    <li>Constant across a project</li>
                </div>
            </ol>

            ---

            ## Useful tools

            - Stata:
              - `isid`
              - `ieduplicates` (from `iefieldkit`)
              - `duplicates`
            - R:
              - `unique`
              - `nrow` 
              - `n_distinct` (from `dplyr`)
              - `get_dupes` (from `janitor`)
              - `isKey` (from `dataReporter`)

            ---

            ## Completeness
            
            - Missing values are common source of issues when handling data
            - When inspecting new data, check that the data is complete
              - Across time
              - Across space or groups
              - Across units of observation
            
            Note:
            - Skip patterns should normally be predictable. For example, you're only asked how many hours a week you work if you are employed
            - Do all the observations in one region show missing values for a particular variable? 
            - Is a particular enumerator skipping entire survey sections?
            - Was some information only collected after a certain date?
            
            ---

            # Useful tools

            - Stata: 
              - `missing()` 
              - `misstable`
            - R: 
              - [`naniar`](https://naniar.njtierney.com/)
              - `is.na`
              - `remove_empty` (from `janitor`)
              - `dataReporter`

            Note:
            Look at the data
            - There is one ID missing from each month
            - Let Rathan explain how this caused issues and how he identified that this was happening

            ---

            ## Consistency

            Values in a data set should be consistent
            1. For any given variable across observations
            1. Across variables for any given observation
            1. For related information across data tables
            1. With pre-existing information and common sense 

            <p class="highlight fragment fade-in">
                This is the most subjective issue in the list, and requires knowledge of the data and of the subject matter
            </p>

            Note:
            Ask for examples for each case:
            1. Yes/No and Y/N used for the same variable
            1. Pregnant males
            1. Mother says she has no children on mother data table, but is listed as a mother in the children table
            1. Being 150 years-old is not reasonable, if we know there are only 10 states in a country, we should not have data for 8 different states

            ---

            # Useful tools

            - Stata: [`ipacheck`](https://github.com/PovertyAction/high-frequency-checks)
            - R:
              - [`validate`](https://data-cleaning.github.io/validate/)
              - [`pointblank`](https://rich-iannone.github.io/pointblank/)

            Note:
            Look at the data
            - September only has 30 days
            - Why is this a problem?
            - It would, for example, bias the daily average

            ---

            ## Extreme values
                      
            - Identifying outliers can help us find incorrect values in our data
            - However, extreme values are not always mistakes
            - Still, even correctly measured outliers can affect our analysis
            - For example, by leading to results that are driven by only a few units in our sample
            
            <p class="highlight fragment fade-in">
                So how should we handle them?
            </p>

            Note:
            I'm sorry to say I don't have an answer

            - Outliers?
            
            ---

            ## Food for thought
            
            <ul>
                <li>There is no exact rule for what is an outlier</li>
                <li class="fragment fade-in">Separating outliers from mistakes often comes down to common sense</li>
                <ul class="fragment fade-in">
                    <li>Can this valued be explained by a typo?</li>
                    <li>Is there more information in the data we can use to confirm whether it's an error?</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="highlight fragment fade-in">
                During data validation, finding and flagging this cases is more important than having a plan for how to deal with them
            </p>

            ---

            ## When to validate data

            <div class="highlight fragment fade-in">
                As soon as you get your hands on a new data set!

            ## Making corrections

            Whether to make changes to values or not is a controversial point. 
            <span class="fragment fade-in">But here are a few points where there is not as much controversy:</span>

            <div>
                <ul>
                  <li class="fragment fade-in">Observations with problematic values should be flagged.</li>  
                  <li class="fragment fade-in">If you do make corrections, make them through code and carefully document the process or reasoning that led you to find the corrected value.</li>
                  <li class="fragment fade-in">You should check how sensitive your results are to data quality issues. This can be done by simulating noise or by testing what happens when you disregard observations with suspicious values.</li>  
                </ul>
            </div>

            ## Data documentation

            <ul>
              <li class="fragment fade-in">Good data sets are accompanied by good <b>metadata</b> (data that provides information about other data)</li>
              <li class="fragment fade-in">When ingesting, cleaning, and validating our data, we will uncover important information that should be documented</li>
              <li class="fragment fade-in">Like tidying data, creating data documentation is not something that is intuitive or that we are typically trained to do, so it will also have it's own session</li>
              <li class="fragment fade-in">For the purpose of this session, you only need to know that everything you find out about your data that will be important for analysis 
                should be carefully written down to that everyone else working in the project (including yourself in the future) also knows about it</li>

            ## Recap

            <ul>
              <li class="fragment fade-in">Touch whatever you want</li>
              <li class="fragment fade-in">Please don't move anything</li>
              <li class="fragment fade-in">Be mindful of sensitive data</li>
              <li class="fragment fade-in">Create good data sets</li>
            </ul>

            Note:
            - Interact without the data! Eye-check it, summarize it, plot it.
            - Protect your raw data, save clean data sets separately from the raw data
            - Store sensitive data in UChicago Box, separate identifying information if possible, don't include names and other sensitive information in the code
            - Cleaning is the first step in creating good data sets. It makes the data more accessible. Validation is the second step. It takes data that is easy to handle and explores it in detail to find any potential issues that may affect your analysis.
