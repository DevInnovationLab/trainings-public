                        ## Some opinionated advice

                        - Data construction should be the only point in your workflow where you are changing the *values* in the data (as opposed to the format of the data)
                        - Create new variables instead of replacing the ones that were originally observed (so you can compare them)
                        - Constructed variables should have intuitive and functional names
                        - The order of variables in your constructed data set can make it easier or harder to find information in it
                        - Keep a lot of documentation on the research decisions involved in data construction
                          - Why did we choose to use one definition and not another?
                          - When was this decision taken and by whom?

                        ---

                        ## Some opinionated advice

                        - Literate programming tools like [quarto](https://quarto.org/), [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [markstat](https://grodri.github.io/markstat/) are very useful throughout data processing and analysis
                        - They can be used to quickly compile documents with graphs and tables
                        - But they can also be used to document data processing by writing actual text with your code instead of only writing occasional comments
                        - You can find a short example [here](https://raw.githack.com/luizaandrade/r-example/main/assignment.html)

                      Note:
                      - My PI likes to use overleaf, and before every meeting I need to upload all the new analysis results to the website and recompile the document
                      - My PI asked me to run some complicated regressions. I spent a lot of time and energy getting the code to run. When it finally did, 
                      I outputted it into a table and shared it with my PI, who immediately noticed the number of observations was varying a lot from one column to the other
                      - My PI decided to change the set of control variables for all analysis in a project and it took me a long time to find all the different lines in all the different scripts where I listed the controls
                      - My results changed every time I ran a regression
                      - My PI asked me to do some initial analysis. I created a table and exported it to Excel. They asked me to do some very specific formating on Excel and I did it, 
                      but then they decided to make a lot of changes to the analysis and for every change I had to spend a lot of time formatting the table again only for them to decide they wanted try to something else

                        <ol>
                        <li class="fragment fade-in">Starts with a fresh workspace</li>

                        </ol>

                        Note:
                        - it starts with a fresh workspace so it does not depend on having run anything in particular before
                        - note that there is no data processing going on. this is because we want the reader to be able to focus on the methods

                        - Is easy to maintain even if research decisions change

                    ## Modularity

                    <span class="highlight"><b>Modular programming:</b></span> is a software design technique that emphasizes separating the functionality of a program into independent, 
                    interchangeable modules, such that each contains everything necessary to execute only one aspect of the desired functionality.

                    ---

                    ## Don't reinvent the wheel

                    <ul>
                        <li>There are plenty of existing packages for statistical analysis and presentation of results</li>
                        <li>Canned functions often go through some sort of review</li>
                        <li>They are also usually programmed to handle errors and edge cases</li>
                        <li class="fragment fade-in">Don't try to write code from scratch unless there is no other way to implement your analysis</li>
                        <li class="fragment fade-in">If you are not 100% confident about a package, test it and compare results with those of another software</li>
                    </ul>

                    ---

                    ## In practice

                    - Define research inputs such as outcomes and controls in one place, and retrieve these inputs when needed
                    - Use functions to simplify and standardize aspects of the code that are not related to the research, such as graphics themes and table formatting
                    - Use file names and document outlines to connect code to specific results

                    <li>The most common source of unstable results are random processes</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="fragment fade-in">Remember to set a seed if they are present in your code</li>

                    </ul>

                    ---

                    ## Unstable results

                    - An easy way to find out if your results are unstable is to track changes to them
                    - Export tables to TeX or csv and track them using git
                    - GitHub can also track changes to images
                    - Rerun analysis after making changes to the data even if the analysis scripts didn't change and check if your results are changing

                    ---

                    ## Using categorical variables correctly

                    - Stata does not automatically recognize labeled variables as categorical variables
                    - To control for different categories of a variable, use factors in R and the `i.` operator in Stata
                    - Avoid creating a series of dummies to represent each individual category
                    - If you are not interested in the coefficients of fixed effects, use commands that don't report them automatically

              <li>It's helpful to start writing analysis code with the most simple version of a model, even if you don't plan to report these results</li>

            ---

            ## Start simple

            - For initial and exploratory results, you want to be able to update outputs quickly
            - These outputs will typically only be used by people in the research team who are familiar with the project
            - Markdown documents are a great solution for this, with the added advantage of being able to see the code
            - Don't stress too much about the perfect formatting for every single table and figure
            - Iterate on this format of document until you know what results you want to present

            ---

            ## But be mindful of details

            - When your code runs, you are only half done!
            - Spend some time interpreting results and understanding them before sharing them with PIs
            - Think critically about the numbers you see: 
              - Do they make sense to you?
              - What additional questions can you anticipate based on the results?

            ---

            ## Polishing final outputs

            - You want to minimize the number of times you will make precise adjustments to the aesthetics of outputs
            - But at least one team member needs to learn the nitty gritty of formatting tables and creating graphs
            - Agree on a style before you start formatting tables and figures
            - Have in mind who is the audience of the outputs while doing so
            - Remeber that tables and figures should be self-standing: labels and detailed notes are important

            ---

            ## Writing code for final outputs

            - Automate the creation of outputs and final documents as much as possible
            - Stay away from workflows that rely on copy-pasting
            - Use accessible formats to save output (png, svg, tex, csv)
            - In Stata: `outreg2`, `esttab`, `graph export`
            - In R: `stargazer`, `huxtable`, `kable`, `modelsummary`, `ggsave`
