						# Documenting Data Work
						February 10, 2023

					</textarea>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>
						
						## Motivation

						- How long did it take you to find your way around the data and code for the last project you took over from someone else?
						- Did you ever work on a piece of analysis or data cleaning only to find out that someone else (or maybe event yourself) had already done the same thing?
						- If your PI asked you how many different data sets were used in your last project, how long would it take you to answer?
						- Did you ever took over code that you simply could not run?

						---

						## Data principles

						- Please don't move anything
						  - Know where things are
						- Show, don't (just) tell
						  - Easily see what the data looks like
						- Create good data sets
						  - 
						
						---

						## Coding principles

						- Code should live forever
						- Be kind to your reader
						- Track your changes
						- Automate your workflow

						---

						## On/offboarding checklist

						- [ ] Get access to all relevant documents (GitHub repositories, shared folders, Overleaft documents)
						- [ ] Make sure all the files for the project are stored in a single folder, or create a README file linking to all the different locations where they may sit
						- [ ] Create a backup of raw data if it doesn't exist yet
						- [ ] Update project documentation
							- [ ] List of data sets
							- [ ] Data dictionaries
							- [ ] Folder structure
							- [ ] Notes on important research decisions
						- [ ] Make sure the project has a main script that
							- [ ] Maps file paths to relevant directories
							- [ ] Calls all other scripts
							- [ ] Indicates the inputs and outputs for each subscript
							- [ ] Briefly describe what each subscript does
							- [ ] You are actually able to run

						## Project README: ongoing projects

						- When interacting with the code for the first time, what do you need to do to set up?
						- What software does the project use?
						- How can you run the entire code for the project?
						- Where does the code sit? And the data? And the outputs (tables, figures)? And the documentation?
						- How are folders structured?
						- What are all the data sources for the project? Which data tables come from each source?

						example

						## Project README: reproducibility package

						- When interacting with the code for the first time, what do you need to do to set up?
						- How can you run the entire code for the project?
						- What software does the project use? Which packages are necessary?
						- How are folders structured?
						- What are all the outputs created by the code? Which script (line) creates them? Which data tables are used as input?		

						example

						## Creating and updating a README

						- Start from a template and add as much information as you have available
							- Markdown template
							- Word template
							- LaTeX template
						- Update it whenever an important task is completed: new data was acquired, new analysis was developed, new round of data processing
							- Update the README every time you open a pull request
							- If you don't use GitHub, update it every 3 months

					## List of data sources 
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>

						## List of data sources: content

						- What are all the relevant raw data sets for the project?
						- Where are they stored?
						- Where are they backed up?
						- Where did they come from?
						- What time period do they cover?
						- What is their unit of observation?
						- What are variables uniquely identify observations?
						- What are the main variables they contain?

					## Data dictionaries
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template>

						## Data dictionaries: content

						- What is the level of observation for this data set? What variable uniquely identifies it?
						- How many observations does it include?
						- What is the source of the data?
						- Link to additional documentation
						- What are all the variables in the data set?
						  - What type of information do they contain (binary, continuous, categorical)
						  - How are they defined?
						  - In what unit are they measured?

						---

						## Creating and updating data dictionaries

						In Stata:
						- Use `iecodebook, export` to export a list with
							- Variable name
							- Variable label
							- Variable type
							- Value label			
  
						---
  
						## Creating and updating data dictionaries in Stata

						<pre>
							<code>
								sysuse auto, clear
								iecodebook export using "${codebook}/auto_export.xlsx", replace
							</code>
						</pre>

						---

						## Creating and updating data dictionaries in Stata

						In Stata:
						- Use `iesave` instead of `save` to save a file with
							- Variable names
							- Variable label
							- Variable type
							- Descriptive statistics
						- Save the metadata to GitHub to track changes to the data
						- Make sure that no confidential information (e.g. examples of text values or gps coordinates)  is included in the metadata stored in GitHub

						## Creating and updating data dictionaries in Stata

						<pre>
							<code>
								sysuse auto, clear

								iesave "${box}/data/auto.dta", ///
									idvars(make) ///
									version(13.0) ///
									report(path("${github}/data/auto.md"))
							</code>
						</pre>

						## Creating and updating data dictionaries

						In R:
						- `dataMeta`: similar to `iecodebook`, creates a table with variable names and labels
						- `datadictionary`: similar to `iesave`, adds descriptive statistics and can be used to track changes to the data
						- `skimr`: similar to `iesave`, adds descriptive statistics and can be used to track changes to the data

						## Documenting research decisions

						- RCT studies take years to complete. During this time, team members will come and go, and discussions will come up over and over again.
						- It should be easy for anyone in the team to remind themselves of how and why research decisions were made, such as
							- Why a certain analysis uses a particular sample
							- Why a regression uses random effects and not fixed effects
							- Why one indicator definition was preferred over another


						---

						## Documenting research decisions

						The best way to do this is whatever works for your team, and is often a combination of
						- GitHub issues
						- README files
						- Comments to code
						- Asana
						- Meeting notes on google documents
						- Slack threads
						
						Whatever system you decide to use, make sure everyone in the project is aware of it and make a plan to keep it up to date
