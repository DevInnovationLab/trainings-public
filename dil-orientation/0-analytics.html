            ## Standard practices

            Note:
            - Most of the things we discuss in this session are recommendations of things that in our experience will save time and make everyone's lives easier, but
            - Each project is unique and the research team working on it is the best judge of what it needs and how their time and resources are best spent
            - However, there are three things that we very strongly recommend every project should do

        <section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
					<textarea data-template>

            1. Do a code check before <b>submitting papers</b>
            2. Prepare well-documented reports of <b>power calculations</b>
            3. Use GitHub to <b>track change to code</b>

            Note:
            - Before submitting papers, reach out to the stats team about reviewing the project's reproduciblity package
            - Use version-controlled code for power calculations and document all the decisions involved (Alex will discuss this in more detail in his session)
            - Version control all project code using GitHub: this feeds into 1 and 2. there will be a session on github on Thursday

            ## DIL and UChicago resources

            - Midway computing cluster
            - DIL GitHub organization
            - DIL SurveyCTO server
            - Overleaf premium
            - Qualtrics 

            Note: 
            - These are all linked on the Lab Manual, but here's a recap of the main resources available
            - SCTO 
              - Discounted prices when at least 10 teams are collecting data at the same time
              - Login through UChicago for added security
            - Use DIL GitHub instead of personal GH so we can always access the code
            - Midway cluster for big data: takes some learning, but useful when running code that takes more than 30 min or so repeatedly
            - Linked on the Lab manual

            ---

            ## Project support

            - You can always share questions about data and code at the `#_analytics_help` Slack channel
            - Reach out to Luiza for more hands-on requests, such as
              - Preparing reproducibility packages for paper submission
              - Migrating a project to GitHub
              - Reviewing project code
              - Designing data pipelines
              - Managing big data
